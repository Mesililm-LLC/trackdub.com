    introduction:
      "LinML separates shared contracts (`LinML.Contracts`), selection rules (`LinML.Policy`), plugin staging (`LinML.Catalog`), and native ONNX Runtime sessions (`LinML.Runtime.Onnx`). That gives developers a place to inspect device readiness and make provider choices before inference, then examine runtime diagnostics when execution differs from expectation.",

      "Numan treats trust, installation, and activation as separate steps. It verifies the official registry index with a built-in Ed25519 trust root, checks plugin binaries against SHA-256 hashes, and locks package version, payload hash, and origin. Installation leaves Nushell state untouched until a user explicitly activates supported packages; hook profiles require a separate opt-in.",
