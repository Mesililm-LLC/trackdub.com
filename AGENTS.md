## Linear (agents)

Track work in Linear workspace [mesalimllc](https://linear.app/mesalimllc) under project **Marketing Site** (label `repo:web`). Agents must search/create/update Linear issues autonomously as progress is made. Link Figma Design System and Notion Specs on visual work. See public-core `docs/operations/linear-workflow.md` when available.

## Cursor Cloud specific instructions

TanStack Start / Vite / Bun / Cloudflare. Local: `bun install`, then `bun run dev` or `bun run build`.

- Install with Bun (lockfile is `bun.lock`), not npm.
- Secrets often needed for full local/cloud runs: `WEB_BOT_AUTH_PRIVATE_JWK` (`.dev.vars`), plus `TURNSTILE_SECRET`, `SITE_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY` (`.env`). Put these in Cursor Secrets for cloud agents; do not commit values.
- Deploy path: `bun run deploy` (build + wrangler). Prefer verifying with `bun run build` in agents unless deploy is explicitly requested.
